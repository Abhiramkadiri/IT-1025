This Project is about an Hybrid Application which is going to be used in future by all the Schools in tamilnadu.

From this application a parent or a teacher can track his/her ward's details such as attendance,performance in studies /extracurricular activities etcc.

Also we included a tracking facility in order to make the student trackable.

Also we are in a plan to include the payment gateway in order to make the fee payments more flexible as cash payments became a hefty task after demonetization.
